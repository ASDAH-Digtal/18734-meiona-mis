         <h2> Introducing Dogs </h2>
          <p> The website that I am creating is all about dogs. I have found that they are really important to people. They are friendly and lovely just like us. Looking at how they act, and how they are dear to people makes me think that they are sop important to us.
          <p>  Nothing that God created is not important. I found out that Dogs helps people with less stress, depression, anxiety etc. Two years ago of muy life till now, my only wish is to have a dog. I watched many videos about them, and they are so helpful just like human. They also protects people from harm <p>
